## Overview

danbooru-ruby-grabber is a danbooru downloader â€” simple script which downloads images from danbooru.donmai.us, konachan.com, e621.net, behoimi.org and yande.re. Support of any danbooru-powered site could be added easily.

## Usage

```

    -s, --storage DIR                Storage mode (all images in one dir and symlinks in tagged dirs)
    -f, --filename PATTERN           Filename pattern. Supported options: id (default), md5, tags, url (old default)
    -u, --user USERNAME              Username

```

## Notes

* To prevent duplicates files are stored using post id based filenames. You can change this behavior using `-f` option.

* Using `-f tags` could miss some files due to filesystems' filename length limitation.

* Always use `-u` and `-p` options with danbooru, because they block requests without login and password.

* Number of tags you can use at the same time could be limited by board (for example danbooru limits basic accounts by 2 tags)

* Images are stored in tag-named directory.

* Script creates file named `files.bbs` with all tags of each image.

## Installation

You need json and nokogiri gems to be installed. You can install them by this command:

`gem install json nokogiri`

Note: may be you need to use `sudo`.

## Bonus

Have fun.
