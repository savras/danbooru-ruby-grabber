danbooru-ruby-grabber is a simple script for download images from danbooru.donmai.us.

I think it can be used for other danbooru-powered sites, but I never test it.

Usage:

ruby danbooru.rb "tag1 tag2 etc"

Images are stored in tag-named directory. Also script creates file named files.bbs with all tags of each image.
