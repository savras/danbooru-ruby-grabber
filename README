    -P, --pool POOLID                Pool ID (tags will be ignored)
    -w, --wget                       Use wget for download

    -u, --user USERNAME              Username
    -p, --password PASSWORD          Password

Please always use -u and -p options with danbooru, because they block requests without login and password.
