danbooru-ruby-grabber is a simple script for download images from danbooru.donmai.us.

I think it can be used for other danbooru-powered sites, but I never test it.

Usage: danbooru.rb [options] "tags"
    -w, --wget                       Use wget for download
    -u, --user USERNAME              Username
    -p, --password PASSWORD          Password

You can use up to 2 tags with basic account. Images are stored in tag-named directory. Also script creates file named files.bbs with all tags of each image.

You need nokogiri to be installed. You can install it by this command:

gem install nokogiri
Note: may be you need to use sudo.

Have fun.
